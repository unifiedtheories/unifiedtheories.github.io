## Silent Video Game Walkthrough - Time To Kill
[VIDEO][gamedev]
This is a video walkthrough of a short video game made in a group of three during my undergraduate education. We were tasked to produce a video game with an original idea, performing user tests on both lo-fi paper prototypes and hi-fi digital prototypes. At the end of the course, we presented our game at the Queen's Creative Computing Showcase. We built a top-down game where the novel idea we pitched involved combining a puzzle game that uses keyboard combinations for attack moves with a time-sensitive adventure.

This is a video walkthrough, set to music, of a web portal representing an imaginary restaurant. We were graded on the structure of our database and the function of the web interactions, the rest of the customization was up to the student. In this assignment we learned about managing data, creating relational databases, and how to code in several languages.
